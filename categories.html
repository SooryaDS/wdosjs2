           <li><h2>Green Turtle</h2></li>
           <br>
           <br>


In Sri Lanka, the green turtle is the one that is most frequently encountered. The Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans all contain them. Thankfully, this practice is less widespread now. Carnivores predominate among young green turtles. Adults, however, are herbivores that use their sharply serrated jaws to only consume marine flora.
<br>
They can weigh up to 250 kg and reach a maximum length of 1m. A mature female will typically lay 120â€“140 eggs at a cycle.

<li><h2>Olive Ridley</h2></li>

<br>
<br>
<p>This sea turtle's name is related to the shade of olive green that may be seen on its shell. Of all sea turtles, they are currently the most prevalent. Because they only nest in a few numbers of locations, any disturbance to even one nest beach might have a significant impact on the entire population.</p>

<li><h2>Hawksbill</h2></li>
<br>
<br>


<p>The word "hawksbill" refers to a bird's short, pointed beak. On their shells, they have a peculiar pattern of interlocking scales that give the edges a serrated appearance. Because of their unique colors and patterns, their shells are quite precious and frequently referred to as "tortoiseshell" in marketplaces.</p>
<br>
<p>Hawksbills are primarily found in coral reefs in the tropical oceans of the world. They mostly eat sponges, which they pull from reef crevices using their tiny, pointed beaks, although they also consume sea anemones and jellyfish. The only surviving members of a group of reptiles that have roamed our oceans for the past 100 million years are sea turtles. They are an essential component of marine ecosystems and support the health of the sea and coral reefs.</p>

<li><h2>Loggerhead</h2></li>
<br>
<br>

<p>The loggerhead turtle, the largest of all hard-shelled turtles, is known for its enormous head and powerful jaws (leatherbacks are bigger but have soft shells). Their heart-shaped reddish-brown carapace is their outer shell. Its hind feet are steady and guide them while their front flippers act as wings to carry them through the water. Male adults typically average around 250 pounds, however loggerheads up to 1,000 pounds have been discovered.</p>
<br>
<p>The Loggerhead is a "keystone species," which means that it is essential to the survival of other species in its environment. These turtles consume invertebrates, whose shells travel through their digestive tracts and, upon excretion, fall back to the ocean's floor where they serve as a calcium supply for other species to consume. Predators eat loggerhead hatchlings as well.</p>

<li><h2>Leatherback</h2></li>
<br>
<br>


<p>The name "leatherback" refers to the leather-like, as opposed to a hard, like other turtles' shell, that this species of turtle has.</p>
<br>

<p>They are the biggest species of sea turtle and among those that migrate the most, traveling across both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Every summer and fall, Pacific leatherbacks travel from their nesting beaches in the Coral Triangle all the way to the California coast to dine on the profusion of jellyfish.</p>
