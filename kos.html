            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            There are 18 turtle hatcheries on Sri Lanka's southern coast, one of which is the Turtle Care Centre at Kosgoda Beach.<br><br>
The center, which was established in 1981, is situated in the coastal community of Kosgoda in   Southwestern Australia.
All five species of the turtles that come to Sri Lanka to lay their eggs nest there, which adds to its appeal.<br><br>
Contrarily, several of the other hatcheries in the area of the island only host a small number of   the species on their beaches.
<br><br>
The center's primary purpose is that of a hatchery, and it works extremely hard to raise the rate of hatching and the survival of young turtles.
Yet the care center also treats individuals who are ill or injured, providing medical care.
<br>
<br>
<br>

 <h2>The steps taken by the hatchery are as follows:</h2>
<ul>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<li>The staff searches the beach at night for female sea turtles that emerge from the water to lay eggs.</li>
<br>


<li>Until the mother has finished laying the eggs and has returned to the ocean, they guard the mother from a distance while she is in the nesting stage.</li>
<br>

<li>To keep the eggs safe from predators and careless human behavior, the eggs are moved from  the beach to the hatchery.</li>
<br>

<li>Fishermen are additionally compensated for bringing any turtle eggs they locate to the  hatchery.</li>
<br>

<li>In a safe environment, the eggs grow and hatch.
It can take 45 to 60 days to complete.</li>
<br>

<li>If there are no issues, the newly hatched turtles are released into the water that same day. 
This is done to limit human influence on their way of life as much as possible.</li>
<br>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<br>
