<li><h2> Sea turtles can't pull their heads back into their shell like other turtles can when faced with    danger. </h2></li>
<br>
<br>
<p>The heads and flippers of sea turtles, however, cannot be retracted inside their shells. The "sidenecked turtles" and the "hidden neck turtles" are the two main categories for turtle     species that have the ability to retract their heads. </p>
<br>
<p>The manner the head retracts serves as the basis for this classification. 
The sidenecked turtle folds its neck to the side while retracting, whereas the hidden neck turtle retracts  its head straight back into its shell.</p>

<li><h2> Turtles are unable to leave their shell.</h2></li>
<br>
<p>The reptile order Testudines includes turtles. All turtle species have bony shells covering their entire bodies. The plastron is the lower shell, and the carapace is the top shell. 
Their rib and spinal column mature into the bony shells. A skeletal box is created when the upper and lower shells are joined.</p>
<br>
<p>A turtle can never emerge from its shell. The bones and cartilage that make up the turtle's shell are an essential component of its body.</p>
