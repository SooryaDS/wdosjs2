            <b><h2>the significance of turtle hatcheries</h2></b>
            <br>
            <Br>


Turtle eggs that have been left on their own are vulnerable to predators and helpless against them.<Br> Moreover, there is a chance that local fishermen will find the eggs and sell them to poachers, who would then sell them on the black market. 
The hatcheries address this by paying the fisherman more for their eggs, which incentivizes them to keep bringing in the imperiled eggs to a safer area.
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>


<b><h2>Efforts at conservation</h2></b>
<br>
<br>

The eggs are kept safely buried in the sand at the hatchery until they break free of their shells, at which point they are transferred and put into tanks where they will spend the first few days of their life. <br>
Their chances of surviving are increased since they get the chance to get stronger before being returned to the perils of the water. 
This helps to save a number of turtle species.
<br>
<Br><br>
    <br>
    <b><h2>The Things You Can Do</b></h2><br><br>
At dusk, you may observe the young turtles being released on the sand and follow their journey back to the sea. The process of returning newborn turtles to the sea is being observed, and visitors are asked to show consideration.<br> Loud noises are prohibited, as are flash photography and bright lights because they can cause newborn turtles to mistake them for the moon over the water and prevent them from finding their way back home.
<br>
Bentota beach has been home to up to five endangered kinds of turtles for a very long time. Before being released, the turtles are given the opportunity to hatch and grow in a protected environment. For those who like nature, a trip to the turtle hatchery is a must.
